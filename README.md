# PaymentEntry
A C# Windows Forms Project showcasing linking to a Sql Server database (Payables). Shows invoices and line items for a chosen vendor. New items, invoices and vendors can be added or updated and deleted. 
From the Murach book 'ADO.NET with C#'. It is developed from the chapter 10 project 'Payment Entry' and is very similar as a result.
